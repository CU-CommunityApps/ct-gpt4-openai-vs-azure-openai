As sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, its short wavelength light (blue and violet) is scattered in all directions by the gas molecules in the air. However, our eyes are much more sensitive to blue light and less sensitive to violet light. Additionally, sunlight reaches us more from the blue part of the spectrum, rather than the violet end. Therefore, when we look up at the sky, we perceive it as blue instead of violet.\n"

As sunlight travels through the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with gas molecules and tiny particles which causes the light to scatter in all directions. Blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels in shorter, smaller waves. So when you look up at the sky, what you're seeing is this blue light that has been scattered from all over the sky."

      "content": "Dinosaurs went extinct approximately 65.5 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous Period, in an event known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K–Pg) extinction event. The most widely accepted theory for this extinction event is that a comet or asteroid about 10 kilometers in diameter hit Earth in the Yucatan Peninsula (in what's now Mexico), resulting in a series of environmental changes that were unsuitable for dinosaurs and many other life forms.\n\nThis impact would have caused massive tsunamis, fires, and released an enormous amount of dust into the atmosphere which blocked sunlight for several months or even years. This would have resulted in a dramatic drop in temperature (a phenomena often referred to as \"nuclear winter\"), disrupting photosynthesis and causing food chains to collapse, leading to the extinction of most dinosaur species.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that not all dinosaurs went extinct—birds are modern descendants of a group of two-legged dinosaurs known as theropods.\n"

      "content": "Dinosaurs became extinct around 65.5 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous Period, likely due to a catastrophic event often attributed to a large asteroid or comet strike near what is now the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. The impact would have caused massive tsunamis and sent up a dust cloud that blocked sunlight for possibly up to a year, resulting in a dramatic change in climate termed an \"impact winter.\"\n\nThis sudden change would have severely impacted plant life and drastically reduced available food resources, causing a domino effect through the food chains. This theory is supported by the existence of a layer of rock called the K-T Boundary (Cretaceous-Tertiary Boundary) filled with unusually high amounts of iridium typically found in asteroids, found all over Earth.\n\nBesides the asteroid theory, other hypotheses pointing to intense volcanic activity or climatic shifts have also been proposed. However, it's widely accepted that it could be a combination of these factors that led to their mass extinction.\n\nIt should be noted that not all dinosaur descendants went extinct 65.5 million years ago. Birds are modern descendants of a group of two-legged dinosaurs known as theropods."
